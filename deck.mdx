# "How much do you love dogs?"
\- You, probably

<Notes>

- besides dogs i also love to make the web better for  everyone
- what does that mean for me? building community and culture as a meetup organizer and tech leader at work.
- going to conferences and teaching folks how they can make the web better for everyone
- and of course that comes in the form of advocating for accessibility on the web.  Why?
- because at its core, web accessibility is about making apps, sites and tools that work for everyone including people with disabilities.
- and when we build things that can work for everyone on the web, we in turn mak the web better for everyone.
- a11y can be hard, but that doesn't mean we're allowed to just ignore it.
- in fact, we should be looking for opportuninties where we can set ourselves up to be more efficient and resilient in our accessibility practices so that over time we can free ourselves up to dedicating the time and resources we save on solving complex problems.
- And that's where testing and automation come into play.
- As engineers we've already embraced the practice of protecting ourselves from bugs by writing tests and cutting time in our development process through continuous integrations and development.
- We can take those same practices and apply them to developing accessible sites and apps.
- And when we invest in testing and automating parts of our accessibility development, we build confidence in our systems that they will work for everyone, and consequently, make the web better for everyone.
- So today, we're going to talk about how we can do good, without doing anything...
- title thing about it  being somewhat click baity.

# [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse)
An open-source, automated tool for improving the quality of web pages.

<Notes>

- Allows you to run accessibility audits on your website.
- You'll receive a score for how accessible your site is.
- Let you know where you can improve your score and make your site more accessible.

<Notes>

- Lighthouse comes baked into Chrome DevTools
- If you open the "Audits" tab you'll see a list of audits that you can run.

</Notes>

___

<Image src={lighthouseAudit2} />

<Notes>

- We can choose the accessibility audit to run and lighthouse will give us a score out of 100.
- This lets us know how accessible our website is by checking if we're adhereing to accessibility standards and best practices.

</Notes>

___

<Image src={lighthouseAudit3} />

<Notes>

- Along with our score we get a list of improvements to make that will help us make our website more accessible.
- I like to run lighthouse in the devtools when I want to get a sense of a site's baseline accessibility score.
- Or as I make changes to make sure I'm not unintentionally degrading my accessibility support.

</Notes>

___

<Image src={lighthouseAudit4} />

<Notes>

- One perk that lighthouse gives us is that you can use it for running other audits, not just accessibility.
- Performance, best practices, seo, progressive web apps.
- All of this is rolled into one tool so that you can make sure you're building a top quality site without a ton of additional work on your end.

# [react-axe](https://github.com/dequelabs/react-axe)
Open source tool that tests the accessibility of React applications and displays the results in the Chrome DevTools console.

<CodeSurfer>

```js file=./code/react-axe-import.js
```

```js 4:5 file=./code/react-axe-import.js
```

</CodeSurfer>

<Notes>

- Here's how you would use react-axe in your projects.
- NEXT SLIDE
- Note that I'm only running react-axe in NON-PRODUCTION environments.
- It'll be clear why we do that when we see how it works.

</Notes>

___

<FullImage src={reactAxeDemo} />

<Notes>

- Once we have react-axe included in our project, we can load our site and open up the DevTools console.
- And we see that react-axe is adding messages to our console highlighting accessibility errors on the page.
- These messages include a severity rating (minor, moderate, serious) to signal how critical an error is.
- Also includes a link to a helpful resource that gives us details on the error and how we can fix it.
- Different from lighthouse which checks statically, this will evaluate our site as we interact with it.
- That's why we only run in non-production environments, because the performance hit would be detrimental.
