- Not enough to just stop worrying about accessibility after the build phase
- there's so much more work that goes into our apps after we've pushed it out into production.
- there's maintanence, bug fixes, and feature development
- everytime we make a change in the codebase we open ourselves up to bugs, regressions.

- Helps you catch common accessibility mistakes in your code while your developing
- Automate it using git hooks to prevent inaccessible code from getting committed
- Can use it in your CI/CD pipeline to fail builds if errors are thrown, prevent accessibility issues from making it into production

<!-- shows the lighthouse accessibility audit for useReact.nyc website -->

<FullImage src={lighthouseAudit1} />

<Notes>

- for now let's look at lighthouse in chrome devtools.
- If you open the "Audits" tab you'll see a list of audits that you can run and some different options we can set.


</Notes>

___

<!-- shows the lighthouse accessibility audit results for useReact.nyc website -->

<FullImage src={lighthouseAudit2} />

<Notes>

- We can choose the accessibility audit to run and lighthouse will give us a score out of 100.
- This lets us know how accessible our website is by checking if we're adhereing to accessibility standards and best practices.

</Notes>

___

<!-- shows all lighthouse audit results for useReact.nyc website -->

<FullImage src={lighthouseAudit3} />

<Notes>

- Along with our score we get a list of where we lost points, and how we can fix these errors.
- I like to run lighthouse in the devtools when I want to get a sense of a site's baseline accessibility score.
- Or as I make changes to make sure I'm not unintentionally degrading my accessibility support.

</Notes>

___

<!-- shows expanded results for useReact.nyc website -->

<FullImage src={lighthouseAudit4} />

<Notes>

- One perk that lighthouse gives us is that you can use it for running other audits, not just accessibility.
- Performance, best practices, seo, progressive web apps.
- All of this is rolled into one tool so that you can make sure you're building a top quality site without a ton of additional work on your end.

<!-- button component code -->

<CodeSurfer theme={github}>

```js file=./code/unit-test-0.0.0.js
```

```js 6,14 file=./code/unit-test-0.0.0.js
```

</CodeSurfer>

<Notes>

- Let's start off with a simple, accessible button.
- NEXT: passing accessibleLabel and conditionally rendering.
- aria-label provides a descriptive label for the element it's applied to so that something like a screen reader can announce to users.

</Notes>

---

<!-- button test that the aria label is there -->

<CodeSurfer theme={github}>

```js file=./code/unit-test-0.0.2.js
```

```js 1 file=./code/unit-test-0.0.2.js
```

```js 3:10 file=./code/unit-test-0.0.2.js
```

```js 5,12 file=./code/unit-test-0.0.2.js
```

</CodeSurfer>

<Notes>

- NEXT start by checking that aria-label attribute is rendered when we pass accessible label prop to it.
- NEXT... create button component, pass accessibile label value to it, render my component
- NEXT... asserting that our button does have the aria-label attribute
- and it's set to the label that we passed to our component.


</Notes>

---

<!-- step through button test for aria-label  -->

<CodeSurfer theme={github}>

```js file=./code/unit-test-0.0.1.js
```

```js 1 file=./code/unit-test-0.0.1.js
```

```js 2:8 file=./code/unit-test-0.0.1.js
```

```js 10 file=./code/unit-test-0.0.1.js
```

</CodeSurfer>

<Notes>

- Also want to test that we only render the aria-label when we have the right prop.
- if accessibleLabel is empty and we render an empty aria-label attribute, assistive technologies may not announce the button to our users, and our users won't know what this button does.
- NEXT: construct our accessible button component and make sure not to pass the accessibleLabel prop
- render that button and query for the button node
- NEXT: what we care about. asserting that our rendered button does NOT have an aria-label attribute
- not too difficult, fairly straightforward.

</Notes>

<!-- button test for focus on the button -->

<CodeSurfer theme={github}>

```js file=./code/unit-test-0.0.3.js
```

```js 10 file=./code/unit-test-0.0.3.js
```

```js 11 file=./code/unit-test-0.0.3.js
```

</CodeSurfer>

<Notes>

- Let's set up another test, this time for focus.
- Testing that our components can gain focus is good for testing keyboard navigation.
- All of our interactive elements need to support keyboard only users.
- only elements that can be focused are interactible with a keyboard
- NEXT: call the focus method on our button.
- NEXT: check that our button is now focused

</Notes>

<!-- accessible button with div subbed in -->

<CodeSurfer theme={github}>

```js file=./code/unit-test-0.0.0.js
```

```js 8,17 file=./code/unit-test-0.0.0.js
```

```js 8,17 file=./code/unit-test-0.0.4.js
```

</CodeSurfer>

<Notes>

- This test protects us in the future from introducing bugs that break keyboard navigation.
- By default html buttons support keyboard nav and focus.
- NEXT: but what if someone comes by and changes our button to a div?
- divs are not focusable elements, and therefore will not support keyboard nav.

</Notes>

---

<!-- failed test for focusing button -->

<FullImage src={failedFocusTest} />

<Notes>

- now this will fail our test and let us know that we've likely introduced a bug in our code that breaks keyboard navigation for our users.
- These are the things we wanna make sure we're testing for.
- Find those test cases in our components that distills down exactly what the outcomes looks like through an accessible lense.
- If i have component that is interactive, that let's me know that i have to check focus to ensure keyboard nav support.
- When my components rely on aria attributes, validate that those attributes are present, and set with the correct values based on different props.

</Notes>

<Layout layout={layouts.sectionTitleBody}>

# Integration Tests
How individual components interact with each other

</Layout>


<Notes>

- What we just covered in unit tests can also be applied to integration test.
- Less concerned about component APIs
- More about the outcomes of how components come together.
- Can also test aria attributes and keyboard navigation, but this time in the context of multiple components working together.

<!-- Slack component demo gif  -->

<FullImage src={onBlurError} />

<Notes>

- example from useReact website
- slack sign up via email.
- when i focus into the email input and then blur out, validation is run.
- if no valid email, red outline is added to input to signal that i need to add an email.
- i also need to make sure my screen reader users are notified of this error somehow.
- and that's what we're going to test, to make sure that my signal for assistive technologies works.

</Notes>

<!-- Slack component code intro -->

```js 28,29 file=./code/integration-test-0.0.0.js
```

</CodeSurfer>

<Notes>

- Let's take a look at this component.
- Composed of multiple components that this container passes props to.
- NEXT: Accessible input accepts onBlur function 
- NEXT: And there's an accessible alert component that accepts an error message if there's an error with validation.

```js 3 file=./code/integration-test-0.0.1.js
```

</CodeSurfer>

<Notes>

- Here's our accessible alert component
- NEXT: it's visually hidden so it doesn't show up on the page because this component is only here for assistive technologies.
- NEXT: role=alert. aria attribute that will announce changes to this component.  When we add an error message, a screen reader will announce that message.
- empty to start because only changes to the node are announced.

```

```js 18:23 file=./code/integration-test-0.0.2.js
```

</CodeSurfer>

<Notes>

- Let's look at a simple test SlackSignupContainer.
- NEXT: test that my alert is updated when the input is blurred an no valid email address.
- NEXT: render my signup container component and get references to input and alert components.
- NEXT: focus into my input and assert that my alert contains no text in it, should be empty when first rendered.
- NEXT: blur out without a valid email, assert that my alert component does receive our error message.
- Lots of moving parts, but guiding principles the same: in this case checking that behaves accessibly through different states.
- can also check that components still manage ARIA correctly, keyboard nav.

- NEXT: let's check that when my page renders in the browser, organizers all have alt text
- NEXT: cypress query for our organizer images
- NEXT: then get the alt attribute values for all of our images.
- NEXT: and assert that this should have a length of 5, equal to the number of organizers we have.
- For the sake of time this is an overly simplified test. But what's important here is getting to the root of how a user would flow through our websie, and translating that into tests..

<Notes>

- It was quite a bit to cover in the amount of time that we have, and there's still plenty to uncover that will help you create an accessibility development workflow that will benefit your projects and teams.
- But if there's one piece of advice i want to leave you with its this:
- It can feel really overwhelming if this is the first time you've thought about the accessibility of your products, and are taking stock of the work that needs to happen to bring it up to standards.
- But it's not expected that you to have a fully accessible site or 100% test coverage on day one.

<Notes>

- make incremental changes where you can, and consistently chisel away at the accessiblity errors.
- eventually, implementing those small changes add up to possessing a deeper understanding of what it'll take to make your site accessible, and how to make it resilient against bugs.
- Once we have that understanding, and have our automation and testing processes in place, it'll be easier to make our websites work for everyone, and that means it'll be easier to build a better web for everyone.
