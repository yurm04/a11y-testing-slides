<Notes>

- Lighthouse comes baked into Chrome DevTools
- If you open the "Audits" tab you'll see a list of audits that you can run.

<Image src={lighthouseAudit2} />

<Notes>

- We can choose the accessibility audit to run and lighthouse will give us a score out of 100.
- This lets us know how accessible our website is by checking if we're adhereing to accessibility standards and best practices.

</Notes>

___

<Image src={lighthouseAudit3} />

<Notes>

- Along with our score we get a list of improvements to make that will help us make our website more accessible.
- I like to run lighthouse in the devtools when I want to get a sense of a site's baseline accessibility score.
- Or as I make changes to make sure I'm not unintentionally degrading my accessibility support.

</Notes>

<Image src={lighthouseAudit4} />

<Notes>

- One perk that lighthouse gives us is that you can use it for running other audits, not just accessibility.
- Performance, best practices, seo, progressive web apps.
- All of this is rolled into one tool so that you can make sure you're building a top quality site without a ton of additional work on your end.

# [react-axe](https://github.com/dequelabs/react-axe)
Open source tool that tests the accessibility of React applications and displays the results in the Chrome DevTools console.

```js file=./code/react-axe-import.js
```

```js 4:5 file=./code/react-axe-import.js
```

</CodeSurfer>

<Notes>

- Here's how you would use react-axe in your projects.
- NEXT SLIDE
- Note that I'm only running react-axe in NON-PRODUCTION environments.
- It'll be clear why we do that when we see how it works.

</Notes>

___

<FullImage src={reactAxeDemo} />

<Notes>

- Once we have react-axe included in our project, we can load our site and open up the DevTools console.
- And we see that react-axe is adding messages to our console highlighting accessibility errors on the page.
- These messages include a severity rating (minor, moderate, serious) to signal how critical an error is.
- Also includes a link to a helpful resource that gives us details on the error and how we can fix it.
- Different from lighthouse which checks statically, this will evaluate our site as we interact with it.
- That's why we only run in non-production environments, because the performance hit would be detrimental.
