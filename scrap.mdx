<Notes>

- Here's how you would use react-axe in your projects.
- NEXT SLIDE
- Note that I'm only running react-axe in NON-PRODUCTION environments.
- It'll be clear why we do that when we see how it works.

# [ARIA Attributes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA)
HTML attributes that help define the semantics of an element or component for assistive technologies.

<small><a href="https://youtu.be/lxxYParyAGk?t=24456">ðŸ“£ Watch my talk on building accessible components</a></small>

</Layout>

<Notes>

- ARIA attributes provide more information to assistive technologies like a screen reader so they understand our components.
- We want to make sure that we're including them where appropriate, making them perfect to test for.
- Go to my talk on accessible components to learn more about ARIA and how to use.

<!-- button component highlighting aria-label -->

<CodeSurfer>

```js 13,14 file=./code/unit-test-0.0.0.js
```

</CodeSurfer>

<Notes>

- The ARIA attribute we want to test for here is called 'aria-label'
- it provides a label for the element it's applied to so that something like a screen reader can announce to users.

- will fail if there are any accessibility errors.
- if you don't want to run something like react-axe or lighthouse, this is a great low effort alternative
